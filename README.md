# DVB-Subtitle-Stream-Inspector
A basic application to examine DVB Bitmap Subtitle TS streams. Based enitrely on the excellent Subtitle Edit Code

# Background
I wrote this to inspect some DVB subtitle compositions, it is entirely based up on the DVB Subtitle code in Subtitle Edit ( https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit/ ) from which
all the code is taken.

It's a work in progress at present

# Windows Binary
There's a beta release ZIP file on https://github.com/hardim11/DVB-Subtitle-Stream-Inspector/releases

The application does not need installing, just extract the ZIP file and run it (although you will get warnings about it not being a trusted file / known file)
