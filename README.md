# DVB-Subtitle-Stream-Inspector
A basic application to examine DVB Bitmap Subtitle TS streams (only files at present). Based enitrely on the excellent Subtitle Edit Code

# Background
I wrote this to inspect some DVB subtitle compositions, it is entirely based up on the DVB Subtitle code in Subtitle Edit ( https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit/ ) from which
all the code is taken.

It's a work in progress at present

# Wish List
* show DVB descriptors
* maybe add some PCR related information?
* Add live input 
* add optional borders to regions as well as objects?
* add teletext suppport
